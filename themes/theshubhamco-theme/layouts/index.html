      A personal learning hub — built through curiosity, structure, and AI-assisted exploration.
    </p>

    <p>
      This website is a living space where I document what I learn, how I think, and how I structure knowledge across software engineering and creative domains.
      It is not a static portfolio — it evolves as my understanding deepens.

    <!-- AI Transparency Notice -->
    <div class="notice">
      <strong>Transparency:</strong> A significant portion of the writing is created with the help of AI as a learning collaborator—
      used for brainstorming, outlining, and polishing. The learning path, sequencing, examples, and final edits are curated by me.
