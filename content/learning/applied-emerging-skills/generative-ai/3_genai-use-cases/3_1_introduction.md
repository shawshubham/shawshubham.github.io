## Introduction

---

Now that you understand the core building blocks of Generative AI — LLMs, tokens, prompts, embeddings, and fine-tuning — the next step is to see **how these concepts are applied in real systems**.

Generative AI is not a single solution used everywhere in the same way.  
Its value depends heavily on:

- the problem being solved
- the type of output required
- risk tolerance
- how humans remain in the loop

This section explores **practical, real-world use cases** of Generative AI across different industries, focusing on:

- what problems GenAI solves well
- how it is typically integrated
- where it should _not_ be used

The goal is not to showcase tools, but to build **use-case intuition** that helps you decide _when_ and _how_ to apply Generative AI responsibly.

## What You’ll Learn in This Section

- How Generative AI assists software developers
- How it improves customer support without replacing humans
- How content and marketing teams use it safely
- How enterprises use GenAI for internal knowledge and search
- Common architectural patterns behind these use cases

Each use case ties back to the concepts you’ve already learned.
