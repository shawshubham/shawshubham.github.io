# Evolution Of Java

---

Java has undergone significant evolution since its inception, with each version introducing new features, enhancements, and improvements. This section outlines the key milestones in Java‚Äôs evolution, highlighting the major changes and their impact on the language and its ecosystem.

> üí° **Did You Know?**
>
> Java follows a six-month release cycle (March & September), introducing new features frequently.  
> However, not all versions are supported long-term.
>
> That‚Äôs where LTS (Long-Term Support) comes in üëá
>
> - LTS Versions (like Java 8, 11, 17, 21) receive security updates, patches, and stability fixes for several years ‚Äî making them ideal for enterprise and production systems.
> - Non-LTS Versions (like 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 22, 23) are short-term releases ‚Äî great for experimenting with new features but not meant for long-term use.
> - LTS releases appear every 3 years, ensuring developers can plan migrations smoothly.
> - Most frameworks (Spring, Hibernate, etc.) and companies officially support only LTS releases.
>
> **Current LTS Versions:**  
> Java 8 ‚Üí Java 11 ‚Üí Java 17 ‚Üí Java 21 ‚Üí (next: Java 25 in 2025!)

- <b>Autoboxing and Varargs:</b> Introduced autoboxing/unboxing and variable arguments (varargs), making the language more user-friendly and reducing boilerplate code.

### Java 6 (Java SE 6) (2006):

- <b>Web Services and Scripting:</b> Improved support for web services and introduced a scripting API (JSR 223) for integrating other scripting languages.

- <b>Performance and Monitoring:</b> Enhancements in performance, monitoring, and management, along with improvements in the compiler API.

### Java 7 (Java SE 7) (2011):

- <b>Language Enhancements:</b> Introduced the try-with-resources statement, diamond operator, and switch statements for strings.

- <b>Fork/Join Framework:</b> Added the fork/join framework for parallel processing, improving performance for multi-core processors.

- <b>NIO.2:</b> Enhanced the New I/O (NIO) API for better file handling and filesystem operations.

### Java 8 (Java SE 8) (2014):

- <b>Lambda Expressions and Streams:</b> Introduced lambda expressions, the Stream API, and functional interfaces, enabling a more functional programming style.

- <b>Date and Time API:</b> Added a new, comprehensive date and time API (java.time).

- <b>Default Methods:</b> Allowed default methods in interfaces, enabling more flexible API design.

## 4. Recent Developments

---

### Java 9 (2017):

- <b>Modular System (Project Jigsaw):</b> Introduced the module system, allowing better packaging and dependency management.

- <b>JShell:</b> Added an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) tool for easier experimentation and learning.

### Java 10 (2018):

- <b>Local-Variable Type Inference:</b> Introduced the var keyword for local-variable type inference, making code more concise.

### Java 11 (2018):

- <b>Long-Term Support (LTS):</b> Marked as an LTS release, ensuring long-term stability and support.

- <b>New APIs and Features:</b> Added new string methods, the HTTP Client API, and more.

### Java 12 to Java 16 (2019-2021):

- <b>Incremental Features:</b> Introduced a series of incremental improvements, including switch expressions, text blocks, pattern matching for instanceof, records, and sealed classes.
