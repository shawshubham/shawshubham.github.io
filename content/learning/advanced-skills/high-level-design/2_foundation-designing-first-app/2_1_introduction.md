## 1. What This Phase Is About

---

Phase 1 focuses on designing the **simplest meaningful system**.

Before we talk about scale, performance, or complexity, we first learn how to:

- translate requirements into architecture
- identify core system components
- make _intentionally simple_ design choices
- avoid over-engineering early systems

This phase establishes the **baseline architecture** that all future examples build upon.

---

## 2. Example Covered in This Phase

---

### 🧱 Example 1: Simple Web System

In this example, we design a basic web system step by step:

- define requirements
- draw a high-level architecture
- explain why each component exists
- extract core High-Level Design concepts

By the end of this phase, you should be able to confidently say:

> “I can design a real system and explain every architectural decision.”

---

## 3. What This Phase Does Not Cover (Yet)

---

To keep the focus sharp, we intentionally avoid:

- caching and CDNs
- sharding and replication
- messaging systems
- advanced consistency models

These will appear naturally in later phases.
