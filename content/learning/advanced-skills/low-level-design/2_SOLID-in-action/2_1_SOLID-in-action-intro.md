## 1. SOLID Principles in Action: Designing a Real System from Scratch

---

> _Apply each SOLID principle step-by-step to a real-world Java application and evolve it into a clean, production-ready design._

You’ve already learned the theory behind each principle. Now it’s time to see how to use them in practice — by designing a modular, maintainable, and scalable system step by step.

## 2. Real-World Project: Employee Management System

We’ll use a realistic business requirement — building an Employee Management System — as our design problem.

As the system evolves with new business needs, you’ll learn how to:

- Identify code smells and anti-patterns
- Apply the right SOLID principle at the right stage
- Refactor and evolve the design without breaking existing functionality

## 3. Structure of This Phase

Each section introduces a business requirement, shows a naive implementation, and then applies a specific SOLID principle to improve the design.

| Phase         | Focus                                                                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SRP in Action | Assign clear responsibilities to services, formatters, savers             |
| OCP in Action | Extend saving logic (file, DB, API, etc.) without modifying existing code |
| LSP in Action | Create class hierarchies where subclasses respect expected behaviors      |
| ISP in Action | Split large interfaces into smaller, focused contracts                    |
| DIP in Action | Depend on abstractions instead of concrete implementations                |

## 4. Why This Approach?

This hands-on journey will help you:

- Master each SOLID principle with practical Java code
- Understand the evolution of clean code in growing systems
- Build a strong foundation for design patterns, system design interviews, and real-world projects

### 🔗 What’s Next?

We’ll now start building the Employee Management System from scratch — beginning with the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**.

👉 **[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in Action →](/learning/advanced-skills/low-level-design/2_SOLID-in-action/2_2_srp-example1)**  
We’ll explore SRP with detailed scenarios, anti-patterns, and how SRP applies not just to classes but also methods, packages, components, and services.

> 📝 **Takeaway**:
>
> - You’ll design a real-world system from scratch by applying each SOLID principle in sequence.
> - Learn how to recognize poor design and refactor toward clean architecture.
> - Develop intuition on when and how to apply SOLID to real business problems.
> - Build a solid foundation to tackle design interviews and production-grade systems.
