## Overview

---

This page is **a personal Git reference guide** — a practical, no-fluff collection of commonly used Git commands and workflows.

It is intentionally **reference-oriented**, not a full tutorial. The goal is:

- Quick recall during daily work
- Safe recovery from common mistakes
- Clear mental models for branching, rebasing, and cleanup

A structured Git tutorial will follow later.
