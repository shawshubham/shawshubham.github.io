# Problem Solving — A Phase-Based Learning Strategy

After understanding **how interviews evaluate problem solving**  
and **how to approach an individual problem**, the next question is:

> _How should I structure my overall preparation so it actually works?_

This article answers that.

---

## 1. Why a Phase-Based Strategy Is Necessary

Most interview preparation fails for one reason:

> **People mix learning, speed, and interview pressure together.**

This creates:

- panic under time pressure
- shallow pattern recognition
- fragile solutions

To avoid this, problem solving must be learned in **distinct phases**, each with a clear goal.

---

## 2. Phase 1 — Pattern Mastery (Remove Fear)

### 2.1 Purpose

Ensure **no common interview problem feels unfamiliar**.

At this stage:

- Speed does **not** matter
- Perfection does **not** matter
- Recognition and correctness **do**

If a problem makes you freeze, it means the pattern is not yet internalized.

---

### 2.2 Scope (Patterns, Not Problems)

Phase 1 is about mastering **problem-solving patterns**, not collecting solved questions.

You must be comfortable with these foundational patterns and tools:

- Frequency counting (maps / arrays)
- Two pointers
- Sliding window (variable & fixed)
- Prefix / suffix arrays _(as tools, not patterns)_
- Basic hashing
- Simple math reasoning
- Simple simulation / state tracking

Any interview problem should immediately map to one of these.

---

### 2.3 How to Practice in Phase 1

- Pick **one pattern at a time**
- Solve **multiple problems of the same pattern together**
- Focus on:
  - Why this pattern applies
  - What the pointer / window / state represents
  - Common pitfalls
  - Edge cases

Rules:

- Java only
- No timing pressure
- No random problem hopping

---

### 2.4 Success Criteria for Phase 1

You move on only when:

- You can identify the pattern within minutes
- You can explain _why_ the pattern fits
- You can write a **correct** solution calmly

If a pattern still feels “hard” → it stays in Phase 1.

---

## 3. Phase 2 — Timed Execution (Speed + Fluency)

### 3.1 Purpose

Convert understanding into **interview-acceptable speed**.

Now:

- Recognition must be **instant**
- Coding must be **fluent**
- Errors must be **minimal**

---

### 3.2 Practice Format

- Timed sessions (30–45 minutes)
- Mixed-pattern problems
- CoderPad-like environment

Rules:

- Java only
- Minimal notes
- Think aloud while coding

---

### 3.3 Focus Areas

- Lock assumptions early
- Structure solutions cleanly
- Handle edge cases proactively
- Finish with working code

---

### 3.4 Success Criteria for Phase 2

- Most problems solved within time
- Code is:
  - Clean
  - Readable
  - Defensible
- No panic when time is running

---

## 4. Phase 3 — Interview Simulation (Interview Dominance)

### 4.1 Purpose

Eliminate **interview-specific failure modes**.

At this point, problem solving is not the bottleneck — communication and control are.

---

### 4.2 Simulation Elements

- Explain while coding
- Handle interruptions
- Answer:
  - “Why not brute force?”
  - “What about edge cases?”
  - “How would you test this?”

---

### 4.3 Additional Focus

- Requirement clarification
- Making assumptions explicit
- Driving the conversation
- Controlling pace and direction

---

### 4.4 Success Criteria for Phase 3

- Pressure does not degrade performance
- You control the discussion
- Interview feels like a technical conversation

---

## 5. Final Mental Model

1. **Patterns first** → no fear
2. **Time pressure second** → speed
3. **Interview simulation last** → confidence

Skipping Phase 1 always causes:

- panic in Phase 2
- failure in Phase 3

This structure prevents that.

---

## 6. Scope of This Tutorial (Important)

This tutorial **intentionally focuses only on Phase 1 — Pattern Mastery**.

That is a deliberate choice.

Phase 1 is where most candidates struggle:

- problems feel unfamiliar,
- patterns are unclear,
- confidence breaks down early.

This tutorial exists to solve **that exact problem**.

---

### 6.1 What This Tutorial Covers

- Core problem-solving patterns
- When and why each pattern applies
- Mental models and invariants
- Common pitfalls and edge cases
- Calm, correct, interview-ready solutions

**Speed is not the goal here.**  
**Recognition and correctness are.**

---

### 6.2 What Readers Must Practice Independently

Once patterns are internalized, readers must move on to:

- **Phase 2 — Timed Execution**
  - timed practice
  - repeated problem solving
  - fluency under constraints

- **Phase 3 — Interview Simulation**
  - explaining while coding
  - handling interruptions
  - real interview pressure

These phases **cannot be taught effectively through tutorials** —  
they must be experienced and practiced.

---

> **Rule to remember:**  
> Patterns can be taught.  
> Speed must be trained.  
> Confidence must be earned.

### 🔗 What’s Next?

With the preparation framework in place, the next step is **Phase 1 — Pattern Mastery**.

From here on, the focus is **not on solving random problems**, but on learning to recognize
**reusable problem-solving patterns** that appear again and again in interviews.

In the next section, we will:

- break problems down by **shape**, not difficulty,
- learn **when** a pattern applies,
- and understand the **mental model** behind each pattern.

> 📌 Remember: speed comes later.  
> Right now, the goal is to make every problem feel _familiar_.
