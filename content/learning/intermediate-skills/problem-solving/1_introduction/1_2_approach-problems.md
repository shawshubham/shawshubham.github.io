# How to Approach a Problem – A Universal Framework

## 1. Why a Framework Matters

---

In interviews, most candidates fail **not because the problem is too hard**, but because they panic, jump to code, or reason inconsistently.

A framework gives you:

- structure under pressure,
- a way to make progress even when unsure,
- and something intelligent to say at every stage.

This article introduces a **universal problem-solving framework** that applies to:

- easy, medium, and hard problems,
- CoderPad and whiteboard rounds,
- real-world debugging scenarios.

You will reuse this framework for **every problem** in this section.

---

## 2. The Universal Problem-Solving Framework

---

The framework consists of **six deliberate steps**:

1. Understand the problem
2. Identify constraints and edge cases
3. Choose the right data structure
4. Choose the right algorithmic pattern
5. Write clean, correct code
6. Validate with examples

Each step is simple — but skipping any of them leads to mistakes.

---

## 3. Step 1: Understand the Problem

---

Before thinking about solutions, ensure you understand **what is being asked**.

**At this stage, focus on:**

- inputs and outputs,
- what the function is expected to return,
- whether anything is ambiguous.

**Good habits:**

- restate the problem in your own words,
- clarify assumptions early,
- confirm expected behavior for unclear cases.

> 📌 Interview signal:  
> Candidates who ask clarifying questions are seen as **careful and senior**, not slow.

---

## 4. Step 2: Identify Constraints and Edge Cases

---

Constraints define what solutions are **acceptable**.

Explicit constraints:

- input size limits,
- time or space expectations,
- data ordering (sorted / unsorted),
- allowed mutations.

Implicit constraints:

- performance expectations,
- memory trade-offs,
- interview time limits.

Common edge cases to surface early:

- empty input,
- single-element input,
- duplicates,
- negative values,
- boundary conditions.

> 📌 Interview signal:  
> Ignoring constraints is one of the fastest ways to fail an otherwise solvable problem.

---

## 5. Step 3: Choose the Right Data Structure

---

Once constraints are clear, decide **how the data should be represented**.

Typical questions to ask yourself:

- Do I need fast lookups?
- Do I need ordering?
- Do I need to process elements sequentially?
- Do I need to track minimum or maximum efficiently?

This step is about **selection**, not implementation.

> 📌 Data structure internals are assumed knowledge and are not re-taught here.

---

## 6. Step 4: Choose the Right Algorithmic Pattern

---

Patterns are **mental shortcuts** that reduce problem complexity.

Instead of thinking:

> “How do I solve this problem?”

Think:

> “What kind of problem is this?”

Examples:

- contiguous data → sliding window
- pair-based comparisons → two pointers
- ordering by priority → heap
- decision trees → backtracking
- overlapping subproblems → dynamic programming

> 📌 Pattern recognition is the single biggest speed multiplier in interviews.

---

## 7. Step 5: Write Clean, Correct Code

---

Only now should you start coding.

Guidelines:

- write code incrementally,
- prefer clarity over cleverness,
- name variables meaningfully,
- avoid premature optimization.

If you get stuck:

- explain what you are trying,
- implement a partial solution,
- improve it step by step.

> 📌 Interview signal:  
> Clear, readable code with explanation beats a rushed optimal solution.

---

## 8. Step 6: Validate with Examples

---

Before declaring the solution complete:

- walk through at least one normal case,
- test edge cases mentally,
- verify constraints are respected.

This step catches:

- off-by-one errors,
- incorrect initializations,
- missed edge cases.

> 📌 Many interview bugs are found **after** coding, not during it.

---

## 9. Common Failure Patterns (What to Avoid)

---

Be consciously aware of these mistakes:

- jumping into code immediately
- optimizing before understanding constraints
- staying silent while thinking
- ignoring edge cases
- over-engineering simple problems

Frameworks exist to prevent exactly these failures.

---

## 10. How This Framework Is Used in This Section

---

Every problem in this Problem Solving section follows this structure:

- problem understanding
- constraints & edge cases
- brute force idea (if applicable)
- optimized approach
- pattern used
- time & space complexity
- final code
- explanation

This repetition is intentional — it trains consistency and confidence.

---

## Key Takeaway

> You don’t need a new strategy for every problem.  
> You need one solid strategy applied consistently.

This framework helps you:

- stay calm under pressure,
- think clearly when the solution is not obvious,
- and demonstrate senior-level problem-solving behavior.
