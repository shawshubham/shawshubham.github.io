# Introduction to Problem Solving

## 1. Why This Section Exists

---

Most coding interviews do **not** test whether you can recall algorithms or data structures from memory.

They test whether you can:

- understand an unfamiliar problem,
- reason about constraints,
- choose an appropriate approach,
- and write correct, explainable code under time pressure.

This section exists to train **that exact skill** — the ability to think clearly when the solution is not immediately obvious.

---

## 2. What Interviewers Are Actually Evaluating

---

During a live coding round (CoderPad, whiteboard, or shared editor), interviewers are not silently judging syntax.

They are actively observing:

- how you interpret the problem statement
- whether you ask clarifying questions
- how you reason about constraints and edge cases
- how you respond when you are unsure
- how clearly you communicate while coding

The final solution matters — but **the thinking process matters more**.

A candidate who thinks clearly and communicates well is often preferred over one who reaches a perfect solution silently.

---

## 3. Knowledge vs Application

---

There is a clear separation of concerns across learning areas:

- **Data Structures** → what tools exist
- **Algorithms** → how problems are solved in theory
- **Problem Solving** → how those tools are applied under real constraints

Many candidates know data structures and algorithms in isolation, yet struggle in interviews because they cannot **connect** them when the problem is unfamiliar.

This section bridges that gap.

---

## 4. What Problem Solving Really Means

---

Problem solving is the ability to:

- translate a problem statement into a solvable model,
- identify what truly needs optimization (time, space, clarity),
- and progressively refine a solution.

It is **not** about arriving at the optimal solution instantly.

It is about making steady, logical progress — and explaining your decisions as you go.

This is exactly what interviews are designed to surface.

---

## 5. Real Interview Constraints

---

Most interviews introduce at least one of the following challenges:

- ambiguous or incomplete requirements
- strict time limits
- unfamiliar problem framing
- follow-up questions that change constraints

This section prepares you to remain structured, calm, and effective in those situations — even when the problem feels uncomfortable at first.

---

## 6. Scope of This Section

---

This Problem Solving section focuses on:

- thinking frameworks
- reusable problem patterns
- execution discipline
- communication during coding

It intentionally avoids:

- teaching data structure internals
- algorithm theory
- design principles (covered in LLD)

Those topics are assumed knowledge and referenced only when needed.

---

## 7. Expected Outcome

---

After completing this section, you should be able to:

- approach unseen problems methodically,
- recognize common patterns quickly,
- write clean, runnable code in live environments,
- and explain your reasoning confidently.

This skill directly applies to:

- CoderPad rounds
- whiteboard interviews
- real-world debugging

### 🔗 What’s Next?

With the purpose and boundaries of problem solving clear, the next step is to learn **how to approach any problem systematically**.

Up next:  
**👉 [How to Approach a Problem – A Universal Framework](/learning/intermediate-skills/problem-solving/1_introduction/1_2_approach-problems)**

This framework becomes the foundation for every pattern and problem that follows.

> 📝 **Key Takeaway**  
> Interviews don’t test how many problems you’ve solved —  
> they test how you think when the problem is unfamiliar.

Problem solving is a skill.  
And like any skill, it can be trained deliberately.
