# About Me

---

Hello, I’m **Shubham Shaw** — a software engineer with a background in Electronics & Communication Engineering, and a deep interest in how people learn, structure knowledge, and reason about systems.

This website is not a traditional portfolio.  
It is a **personal learning space** — a place where I document concepts, patterns, and mental models as I explore software engineering and related disciplines.

---

## What This Website Is

The Shubham Co. is a **living knowledge hub** built around:

- Software Engineering fundamentals
- Java, Spring, and backend systems
- Low-Level & High-Level Design
- Problem solving and engineering thinking
- System design, DevOps, and observability (in progress)

The goal is not to present myself as an authority —  
but to **think in public**, organize ideas clearly, and continuously refine understanding.

## About Content Creation & AI

An important note on transparency:

Much of the content on this site is **AI-assisted** — created through collaboration with AI tools.

However, this is **not copy-paste automation**.

I use AI as:

- A thinking partner
- A clarifier of ideas
- A way to challenge assumptions
- A tool to refine structure, language, and flow

The responsibility for:

- Topic selection
- Learning paths
- Concept sequencing
- Accuracy checks
- Refinement and iteration

remains mine.

This site reflects **active learning**, not passive generation.

## Beyond Code

While software engineering is the primary focus, I also enjoy:

- Sketching and visual thinking
- Creative problem solving
- Exploring structure in non-technical domains
- Music and design experimentation

These interests influence how I approach engineering — with curiosity, structure, and creativity.

## Final Note

If you’re here to:

- Learn alongside me
- Explore structured explanations
- Understand _why_ things work, not just _how_
- See how AI and human reasoning can work together responsibly

then you’re in the right place.

Thank you for being here.
